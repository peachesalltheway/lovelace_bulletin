An attempt at understanding how to connect Firebase / Firestore to projects created in XCode using Swift. First attempt at using terminal to install cocoapods and understanding terminal commands such as 'init' and debugging errors that arose using StackOverflow. Given the time constraint, I was unable to fully integrate an authentification system into the xcode project with stylized elements to create an interactive sign in / up page for users, but used the given time to explore the importance / application of FIrebase security systems in iOS apps
